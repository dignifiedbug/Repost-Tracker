# Repost-Tracker
A tool to alert you when a repost is submitted.

### Running
Run *download_history.py* to create a database. The history.db file will be created by default.

Run the main program with *repost_tracker.py*.

### Recommendations
[A comprehensive guide to running your bot](redd.it/3d3iss) should help answer most questions.

Expect download_history.py to take a while (depending on the size of your subreddit). It may finish before 100%.

DB Browser (*[Website](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)*, *[Github](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)*) for SQLite is an excellent tool to view your database.
